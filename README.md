## Cross-Platform Mobile Guide for Native iOS & Android Developers

### Overview of Mobile Development
Think about your smartphone. It wasn't too long ago that the smartphone market was only emerging. Before, we had to hop onto a laptop or dekstop just to do a quick Google search, and for some of us, this made up even a significant portion of our lifetime. Now everyone is carrying a personalized digital Swiss Army knife in their own pocket. These days, the average person no longer has need to carry around a flashlight or a camera. And the most exciting part about it all is that you, as a mobile software engineer, can develop the skillset to build the apps that go on these devices.

Mobile development is an interesting subfield of programming, as it calls on you to think about the visual design of the front-end client you are building, while bearing in mind the restrictions of the hardware you're building it for--from battery life to network connectivity.

There are many tools available for mobile developers, and the first division to consider is the distinction between native and hybrid platforms. What does this mean? Native indicates the toolsets published and maintained by Apple and Google for their respective platforms. On the flipside, we have hybrid frameworks available that allow us to develop for both Android and iOS with the same codebase. Such frameworks include [Flutter](https://flutter.dev), [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/), and [Xamarin](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin), among many others.

### How to Use This Guide
Here, we will focus primarily on native mobile development tools. This is a beginner-friendly list of curated resources and tips for aspiring engineers in both iOS and Android. More advanced developers can still take advantage of this list as a way to organize a variety of the resources available (and are more than welcome to contribute).

Where other lists tend to focus primarily on one platform or the other, this guide aims to reconcile the similarities and differences between both. Native cross-platform development is a powerful alternative to hybrid development, but it can be daunting to learn the nuances of both platforms, especially for beginners.
